# Useful Commands

Reference doc, not instructions — see CLAUDE.md files for the "why". Run from repo root unless noted.

## Build & test

```
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet test MtgCore.Tests
dotnet test MtgSimulator.Tests
dotnet test SQGodotCommon.Tests
```

## Play in console

```
dotnet run --project MtgConsole
```

## Art pass (download card art)

```
dotnet run --project MtgArtScraper -- SQGodotCommon/MtgGame/Assets/Card_Art HLM
dotnet run --project MtgArtScraper -- SQGodotCommon/MtgGame/Assets/Card_Art CSC
```

Pulls art crops from Scryfall by card name, skips files that already exist. Cards Scryfall
doesn't recognize (your own designs) land in `_needs_art_<code>.txt` beside the output folder.

## Train a draft model

```
printf '4\n\n\n300\n8\n1\n3\nn\ncscfinal\n' | dotnet run --project MtgSimulator.Console -c Release
```

Fields: mode, AI depth (blank=3), format (blank=Booster), drafts, seats, generations, **set
choice** (index printed by the menu — read it, don't hardcode), train-from-scratch, seed. The
`n` is load-bearing — answering the default merges into the old model instead of replacing it.
Writes `sim_results/draft_training_<code>.json`. 300 drafts ≈ 25 min.

**Must run from repo root** — `sim_results/` is relative to the shell's cwd, not the project's.

Godot loads its own copy, not `sim_results/` directly — copy the file across after training:

```
cp sim_results/draft_training_csc.json SQGodotCommon/MtgGame/Assets/draft_training_csc.json
```

Check the new model against the old prior before shipping it:

```
python -c "import json;d=json.load(open('sim_results/draft_training_csc.json'));print(d['Prior'],d['Perspectives'])"
```

## Inspect a trained model

```
node inspect-draft-training.js sim_results/draft_training_csc.json
```
